  description: `I am Ansul Menaria, a dedicated and skilled developer with strong expertise in both AWS Cloud Computing and the MERN stack. I have successfully designed and developed impactful, end-to-end web applications, including a Weapon & Inventory Management System and a Paperless Documentation System for the Indian Army at Udaipur Military Station. With a solid grasp of full-stack development and cloud infrastructure, I build scalable, secure, and user-centric solutions that solve real-world problems.

  Currently interning in an AWS DevOps role, I have gained hands-on experience with cloud services, infrastructure automation, and containerization using Docker. I am passionate about exploring new technologies, solving complex challenges, and continuously improving my skill set. With a collaborative mindset and a strong drive for innovation, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects that deliver real impact.`,
